                               what is  NEO4J?
Neo4j is a graph database management system developed by Neo Technology, Inc. Described by its developers as an ACID-compliant transactional database with native graph storage and processing, Neo4j is the most popular graph database according to db-engines.com

Neo4j is available in a GPL3-licensed open-source "community edition", with online backup and high availability extensions licensed under the terms of the Affero General Public License. Neo also licenses Neo4j with these extensions under closed-source commercial terms.

Neo4j is implemented in Java and accessible from software written in other languages using the Cypher Query Language through a transactional HTTP endpoint, or through the binary 'bolt' protocol
                           My neo4j data structure

I created 59 nodes and 69 relationships, all around the "majorname"node, my idea is "majorname"to connect the GROUPS and Groups  are divided into A, B, C, Group of each connection of different time and place of the LaB, but the three Groupd are connected to the same time and place LECTURE then Each course has a corresponding teacher。   
                             Benefits of NEO4J and  conculsion
       personally,there are some davantages about neo4j.
     
     1. Faster database operations than SQL，In the MySql, the need to store a lot of tables and more contact between the table ( there are a lot of operations need join table)
     2. The data is more intuitive, the corresponding SQL statement is also better to write。
     3. More flexible. No matter what new data needs to be stored, they are all nodes and edges. The MySql means that the new table, but also consider the relationship with other tables。
     
                  Graphic database is the rise in recent years， thats  not suitable for all programs,
                  and Graphic database is relatively narrow.
